## ✨ About me

I'm a frontend developer who combines **technical knowledge** and **visual sensitivity** to create memorable web experiences. I'm currently studying **React** and **TypeScript**, with a focus on building sites with motion.

I like intentional and unforgettable animations.

My projects are not just beautiful webpages: they are visual narratives that invite users to pause browsing and interact, explore curiosity.

Want to see what happens when code becomes art?
